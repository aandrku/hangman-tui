## About

**Hangman** is a terminal-based word-guessing game designed for quick
mental breaks.

You can play it right from your terminal while working, giving your brain
a few moments to relax without leaving your workflow.

The game is simple: guess letters to reveal a hidden word, but beware -
too many wrong guesses and you lose!

Perfect for developers, students, and anyone who lives in the terminal
and needs a small, fun distraction.

## How to play?

### 1. **Play with default words**

To play the game with the default word list, simply execute the binary:
```bash
./hangman-tui
```
The will start from the home menu.
You will be given the opportunity to select the length of the word and number of attempts.
The word must be guessed before you run out of attempts, otherwise you lose.
